# Learning Elixir

After a long time using Ruby and Rails I decided to jump the wagon of Elixir / Phoenix. It doesn't mean I'm abandoning Ruby (I still have production systems running very well with it) and **I LIKE Ruby A LOT**, its comunnity and ecosystem.

In my path to learn it I will follow most of the step's described by Akita in it's post [Yocto Services and My First Month with Elixir](http://www.akitaonrails.com/2015/11/25/yocto-services-and-my-first-month-with-elixir), with some minor changes.

0. Read the official [website](http://elixir-lang.org) and [docs](http://elixir-lang.org/docs.html)
1. Read [The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook](https://www.manning.com/books/the-little-elixir-and-otp-guidebook) by [Benjamin Tan Wei Hao (@bentanweihao)](http://benjamintan.io/). This book still in writing.
